TODO List

- Establish 'value' vs. 'number' difference or combine the terms
- Block object is currently the row and col indexes, should it also have cell values?

- change the return value of run() in strategies from object to just operationLog?

- implement notes within blocks, look for note pairs and have some kind of "resolve notes" strategy?
